Description:
    The my_model generator creates stubs for a new model.

    The generator takes a model name as its argument.  The model name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Model'.

    The generator creates a model class in app/models, an RSpec spec in
    spec/models, factory in spec/factories/plural_name.rb, empty database
    fixtures in spec/fixtures/plural_name.yml, and a migration in db/migrate.

Example:
    ./script/generate my_model Account

    This will create an Account model:
        Model:      app/models/account.rb
        Spec:       spec/models/account_spec.rb
        Factory:    spec/factories/accounts.rb
        Fixtures:   spec/fixtures/accounts.yml
        Migration:  db/migrate/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX_add_accounts.rb
